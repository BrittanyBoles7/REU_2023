Here should be a csv file about the related vulnerabilities. Sometimes G or T will report a vulnerability in a non CVE form, but often they have a CVE equivalent and G and T will tell us when two or more vulnerabilities are related. We want to keep track of these relationships The Protocol section in this folder will generate this table while converting files from json to csv. 

The Columns will be main_vulnerability, related_vulnerability and severity. 

Note right now this list is just generated from  Grype needs further work.
